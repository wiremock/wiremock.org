    <p><strong>Testing microservices with WireMock at Norway's top online marketplace.	</strong><br/>
    Norway's number one online marketplace, used to be a monolith but has migrated to Microservices during the last 4 years. The daily life of developers has become a lot 
    better with Microservices, instead of everyone working on the same monolith. However, a problem arises when testing services thoroughly, as each service is dependent on 
    other Microservices. This has been a big challenge, and has led to a lot of manual testing. However, lately we have started using a tool called WireMock which helps us 
    stubbing out other Microservices. We will explain how this tool has helped us. Hopefully, the talk will help other developers with similar problems to get better testing 
    when using Microservices.</p>

    <p><strong>AWS:Reinvent talk from Intuit on isolating services for testing with WireMock.</strong><br/>
    One of the challenges of implementing CI/CD with service-oriented architectures (SOA) is reliable execution of test automation. Because every service evolves on its own 
    schedule, having a single integrated test environment is virtually impossible. One way to handle this complexity is dependency mocking. We use the Wiremock tool, which 
    allows users to stub for service dependencies and do resiliency testing that was hard to automate before.</p>

    <p><strong>Mock servers in the era of microservices.</strong><br/>
    We are in the era of microservices. One of the advantages of microservices architecture is faster time to market. Development can be split into smaller parts, 
    hence can be developed in parallel. Most of the time microservices communication is done by REST API. With that being said, a question arises as to how to efficiently 
    develop a part of the system that requires communication with another part that is not ready. And the answer is by using mock. This tutorial will show how to easily 
    set up a local mock server.</p>

    <p><strong>Fake It until You Make It! API Integration Testing with Containers & WireMock</strong><br/>
    Testcontainers has become one of the most popular tools for software integration testing. If you can put your system-under-test into a container, Docker compose cluster or a pod, 
    this is what you're likely to use. If your target isn't ready, not containerizable or just too heavy for testing as is, you can always use mock testing frameworks, e.g. WireMock 
    or MockServer in the JVM ecosystem.</p>

    <p><strong>Integration Tests with WireMock and Spring Boot	</strong><br/>
    In this tutorial, we write integration tests for the Spring Boot application using WireMock.</p>

    <p><strong>Response templating - how to create mock APIs that return dynamic responses in WireMock Cloud</strong><br/>
    In this video, we'll show you how to use dynamic response templating in WireMock Cloud to create a powerful mock API that can serve different data using a single stub. Response 
    templating allows you to simulate real-world API behavior by providing variable responses based on the incoming request. This helps you create more realistic tests and examine how 
    downstream components interact with the API in different scenarios.</p>

    <p><strong>Stub External APIs with WireMock and Spring Boot</strong><br/>
    In this tutorial, we stub an external API using WireMock. I also use the new RestClient for the first time to interact with the API.</p>
