WireMock Java is distributed in two flavours - a standard JAR containing just WireMock, and a standalone uber JAR containing
WireMock plus all its dependencies.

Most of the standalone JAR's dependencies are shaded i.e. they are hidden in alternative packages. This allows WireMock to be used in projects with
conflicting versions of its dependencies. The standalone JAR is also runnable (see [Running as a Standalone Process](../standalone/)).

WireMock currently has two releases available.  The `3.x` release (below) and the new `4.x` beta releases.

## 4.x Beta Release Downloads

The `4.x` release of WireMock is currently in beta.  These releases are under active development and we recommend you try it out.  We would love
to hear your feedback over on the community slack - [https://slack.wiremock.org/](https://slack.wiremock.org/)

We have given these releases a beta label due to the fact that as we move forwards with the `4.x` release there **will be
breaking changes**.  See the [version 4](/docs/v4) page for details on the current updates to the `4.x` release.

The version 4 codebase has been refactored to break out the core of WireMock from the various dependencies on external libraries.
This means that you can now choose which dependencies you want to include in your project.
