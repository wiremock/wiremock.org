:::note[WireMock Cloud]

    [Centralize and scale your API mocks with WireMock Cloud.](https://www.wiremock.io?utm_source=oss-docs&utm_medium=oss-docs&utm_campaign=cloud-callouts-solutiontestcontainer&utm_id=cloud-callouts&utm_term=cloud-callouts-solutiontestcontainer)

:::

The WireMock community provides modules for [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/).
They allow provisioning the WireMock server as a standalone container within your tests,
based on [WireMock Docker](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker).

All the modules are under active development.
If there is no module implemented for your technology stack,
a `GenericContainer` implementation from Testcontainers can be used.
For features that are not implemented yet in Module APIs for your language,
it is possible to use the [Administrative REST API](../../standalone/administration/).
Feedback and contributions are welcome!

See WireMock on the [Testcontainers modules listing](https://testcontainers.com/modules/wiremock/).

## Official Testcontainers modules

WireMock Inc. partners with AtomicJar Inc,
a company stewarding the Testcontainers open source project
and providing Testcontainers Cloud and Testcontainers Desktop
([Partnership Announcement](https://www.wiremock.io/post/atomicjar-partnership-on-testcontainers)).
As a part of the partnership,
the following modules were reviewed and certified
as the official modules:

**Java and other JVM languages.**
Java implementation is a separate library that is available to all
JVM languages, e.g. Java, Kotlin or Scala.
See full documentation in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-testcontainers-java).

**Python.**
The Testcontainers Python module is a part of the
[Python WireMock](https://github.com/wiremock/python-wiremock) library,
so a single library integrates bot the CLI client and the Testcontainers module.
See [this page](https://wiremock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testcontainers/)
for all documentation and examples.

**Golang.**
Golang implementation is a multi-platform library that includes the Testcontainers module only.
The module's full documentation and examples are available in its
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-testcontainers-go).
There is a separate library for the CLI, see the [Golang Solutions page](/docs/solutions/golang/).

## Experimental modules

**C/C++ and other native languages.**
We created a WireMock module for
[Testcontainers for C/C++](https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/testcontainers-c).
It allows provisioning the WireMock server as a standalone container within your tests, based on [WireMock Docker](/docs/standalone/docker/).
It allows using WireMock with all popular C/C++ testing frameworks
like Google Test, CTest, Doctest, QtTest or CppUnit.
Read More: [C/C++ Solutions Page](/docs/solutions/c_cpp/).

## Other Languages

All Testcontainers implementations provide
API for provisioning custom containers,
also known as _Generic Container_ API.
It allows using WireMock on platforms where
there is no special Testcontainers module implemented yet:
Node.js, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, etc.

## Code examples

Examples of using the Testcontainers Modules for different languages and Testcontainers modules:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Java">

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.*;
import org.wiremock.integrations.testcontainers.testsupport.http.*;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

@Testcontainers
class WireMockContainerJunit5Test {

    @Container
    WireMockContainer wiremockServer = new WireMockContainer("2.35.0")
            .withMapping("hello", WireMockContainerJunit5Test.class, "hello-world.json");

    @Test
    void helloWorld() throws Exception {
        String url = wiremockServer.getUrl("/hello");
        HttpResponse response = new TestHttpClient().get(url);
        assertThat(response.getBody())
                .as("Wrong response body")
                .contains("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

<TabItem label="Python">

```python

                response=MappingResponse(status=200, body="hello"),
                persistent=False,

        yield wm

def test_get_hello_world(wm_server): # (4)
    resp1 = requests.get(wm_server.get_url("/hello"), verify=False)
    assert resp1.status_code == 200
    assert resp1.content == b"hello"
```

<TabItem label="Golang">

```golang
package testcontainers_wiremock_quickstart

import (
    "context"
    "testing"

    . "github.com/wiremock/wiremock-testcontainers-go"
)

func TestWireMock(t *testing.T) {
    ctx := context.Background()
    mappingFileName := "hello-world.json"

    container, err := RunContainerAndStopOnCleanup(ctx, t,
        WithMappingFile(mappingFileName),
    )
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }

    statusCode, out, err := SendHttpGet(container, "/hello", nil)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err, "Failed to get a response")
    }

    // Verify the response
    if statusCode != 200 {
        t.Fatalf("expected HTTP-200 but got %d", statusCode)
    }

    if string(out) != "Hello, world!" {
        t.Fatalf("expected 'Hello, world!' but got %s", out)
    }
}
```

</TabItem>

## Coming soon

The following modules are under prototyping at the moment: `.NET`, `Rust`.
A lot more features can be implemented in the listed modules,
and any contributions are welcome!
If you are interested, join us on the [community Slack](http://slack.wiremock.org/).
