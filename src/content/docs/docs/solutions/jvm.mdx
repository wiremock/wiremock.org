WireMock was originally created for Java development,
and there are plenty of solutions when developing applications powered by the Java Virtual Machine.

## WireMock

_WireMock_, also known as _WireMock Java_ is the flagman implementation of WireMock functionality and specifications,
maintained on the WireMock GitHub organization.
It is included into many distributions (including [WireMock Docker](../../standalone/docker/)), test framework adapters and products.
Most of the documentation on this website is about _WireMock Java_, unless specified explicitly.

Usage:

- [Running WireMock as a Standalone server](../../standalone/)
- [Using WireMock in plain Java without frameworks](../../java-usage/)

References:

- [WireMock Java on GitHub](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock)

## Integrations with test frameworks

WireMock has integrations with many popular Java test frameworks
for unit and integration testing.

- [JUnit 5+ and Jupiter](../../junit-jupiter/)
- [JUnit 4 and Vintage](../../junit-extensions/)
- [Testcontainers Java](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-testcontainers-java)
- [Spock](https://github.com/felipefzdz/spock-wiremock-extension) - maintained outside WireMock's organization on GitHub

## WireMock Extensions

_WireMock Java_ is [extensible](../../extending-wiremock/),
and there is a number of available extensions that can be included into WireMock
to extend its functionality, including but not limited to request filters, observability, storage, etc.

A few popular extensions:

- Response Template Transformer
    - [Documentation](../../response-templating/)
    - This extension is a built-in part of the WireMock Java, but needs to be enabled explicitly
- Webhooks
    - [Documentation](../../webhooks-and-callbacks/)
- JSON Body Transformer, Callback Simulator, Request time matcher
    - [9cookies/wiremock-extensions](https://github.com/9cookies/wiremock-extensions)
Active
- CORS Protection Extension
    - [RichieLoco/WiremockCorsExtension](https://github.com/RichieLoco/WiremockCorsExtension)
