    [To go beyond simulating faults and test product reliability in unexpected fault scenarios using Chaos Engineering, learn about WireMock Cloud.](https://www.wiremock.io?utm_source=oss-docs&utm_medium=oss-docs&utm_campaign=cloud-callouts-faults&utm_id=cloud-callouts&utm_term=cloud-callouts-faults)


**One of the main reasons it's beneficial to use web service fakes when
testing is to inject faulty behaviour that might be difficult to get the
real service to produce on demand. In addition to being able to send
back any HTTP response code indicating an error, WireMock is able to
generate a few other types of problem.**

## Per-stub fixed delays

A stub response can have a fixed delay attached to it, such that the
response will not be returned until after the specified number of
milliseconds:

```java
stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/delayed")).willReturn(
        aResponse()
                .withStatus(200)
                .withFixedDelay(2000)));
```

Or

```json
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/delayed"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "fixedDelayMilliseconds": 2000
    }
}
```

## Global fixed stub delays

A fixed delay can be added to all stubs either by calling
`WireMock.setGlobalFixedDelay()` or posting a JSON document of the
following form to `http://<host>:<port>/__admin/settings`:

```json
{
    "fixedDelay": 500
}
```

## Per-stub random delays

In addition to fixed delays, a delay can be sampled from a random
distribution. This allows simulation of more specific downstream
latencies, such as a long tail.

Use `#withRandomDelay` on the stub to pass in the desired distribution:

```java
stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/random/delayed")).willReturn(
        aResponse()
                .withStatus(200)
                .withLogNormalRandomDelay(90, 0.1)));
```

Or set it on the `delayDistribution` field via the JSON api:

```json
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/random/delayed"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "delayDistribution": {
            "type": "lognormal",
            "median": 80,
            "sigma": 0.4
        }
    }
}
```

## Global random stub delays

You can set a random delay globally with
`WireMock.setGlobalRandomDelay()` or the JSON api at
`http://<host>:<port>/__admin/settings`:

```json
{
    "delayDistribution": {
        "type": "lognormal",
        "median": 90,
        "sigma": 0.1
    }
}
```

## Available distributions

### Lognormal delay

A lognormal distribution is a pretty good approximation of long tailed
latencies centered on the 50th percentile. It takes two mandatory parameters
plus an optional third:

-   median - The 50th percentile of latencies.
-   sigma - Standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution. The larger the 
    value, the longer the tail.
-   maxValue - (Optional) The maximum value to return. If this value is specified, it 
    must greater than or equal to the median otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` will 
    be thrown. If a value greater than this value is generated, it will be resampled. 
    This is useful for shortening potential long tails that might otherwise cause timeouts
    in calling clients. This option is only available from WireMock version `3.13.0`

[Try different
values](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=lognormaldistribution%28log%2890%29%2C+0.4%29)
to find a good approximation.

To use, instantiate a `new LogNormal(median, sigma)` or `new LogNormal(median, sigma, maxValue)`, or via JSON:

```json
"delayDistribution": {
        "type": "lognormal",
        "median": 80,
        "sigma": 0.4
}
```

or with a maximum value:

```json
"delayDistribution": {
        "type": "lognormal",
        "median": 80,
        "sigma": 0.4,
        "maxValue": 100
}
```


### Uniform delay

A uniform distribution can be used for simulating a stable latency with
a fixed amount of jitter. It takes two parameters:

-   lower - Lower bound of the range, inclusive.
-   upper - Upper bound of the range, inclusive.

For instance, to simulate a stable latency of 20ms +/- 5ms, use lower =
15 and upper = 25.

To use, instantiate a `new UniformDistribution(15, 25)`, or via JSON:

```json
"delayDistribution": {
        "type": "uniform",
        "lower": 15,
        "upper": 25
}
```

## Chunked Dribble Delay

In addition to fixed and random delays, you can dribble your response back in chunks.
This is useful for simulating a slow network and testing deterministic timeouts.

Use `#withChunkedDribbleDelay` on the stub to pass in the desired chunked response, it takes two parameters:

-   `numberOfChunks` - how many chunks you want your response body divided up into
-   `totalDuration` - the total duration you want the response to take in milliseconds

```java
stubFor(get("/chunked/delayed").willReturn(
        aResponse()
                .withStatus(200)
                .withBody("Hello world!")
                .withChunkedDribbleDelay(5, 1000)));
```

Or set it on the `chunkedDribbleDelay` field via the JSON API:

```json
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/chunked/delayed"
    },
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": "Hello world!",
        "chunkedDribbleDelay": {
            "numberOfChunks": 5,
            "totalDuration": 1000
        }
    }
}
```

With the above settings the `Hello world!` response body will be broken into
five chunks and returned one at a time with a 200ms gap between each.

## Bad responses

It is also possible to create several kinds of corrupted responses:

```java
stubFor(get(urlEqualTo("/fault"))
        .willReturn(aResponse().withFault(Fault.MALFORMED_RESPONSE_CHUNK)));
```

The `Fault` enum has the following options:

`EMPTY_RESPONSE`: Return a completely empty response.

`MALFORMED_RESPONSE_CHUNK`: Send an OK status header, then garbage, then
close the connection.

`RANDOM_DATA_THEN_CLOSE`: Send garbage then close the connection.

`CONNECTION_RESET_BY_PEER`: Close the connection, setting `SO_LINGER` to 0 and thus preventing the `TIME_WAIT` state being entered.
Typically causes a "Connection reset by peer" type error to be thrown by the client. Note: this only seems to work properly on \*nix OSs. On Windows it will most likely cause the connection to hang rather
than reset.

In JSON (fault values are the same as the ones listed above):

```json
{
    "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "url": "/fault"
    },
    "response": {
        "fault": "MALFORMED_RESPONSE_CHUNK"
    }
}
```
