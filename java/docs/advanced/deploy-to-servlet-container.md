WireMock can be packaged up as a WAR and deployed into a servlet
container, with some caveats: fault injection and browser proxying won't
work, `\_\_`files won't be treated as a docroot as with standalone, the
server cannot be remotely shutdown, and the container must be configured
to explode the WAR on deployment. This has only really been tested in
Tomcat 6 and Jetty, so YMMV. Running standalone is definitely the
preferred option.

The easiest way to create a WireMock WAR project is to clone the
[sample app](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/tree/master/sample-war).

### Deploying under a sub-path of the context root

If you want WireMock's servlet to have a non-root path, the additional
init param `mappedUnder` must be set with the sub-path web.xml (in
addition to configuring the servlet mapping appropriately).

See [the custom mapped WAR
example](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/blob/master/sample-war/src/main/webappCustomMapping/WEB-INF/web.xml)
for details.
