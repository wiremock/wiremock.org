## Guide by Sam Edwards

As documented by Sam Edwards in 2016,
with some effort it is now possible to run WireMock 2.x on Android.
Please see
[this blog post](https://handstandsam.com/2016/01/30/running-wiremock-on-android/) for instructions.
This guide is likely no longer applicable to the recent versions.

- [Android Http Mocking Examples](https://github.com/handstandsam/AndroidHttpMockingExamples)
- [Shopping App Demo](https://github.com/handstandsam/ShoppingApp) application with API mocking in test automation
  - Now it is based on Ktor, but there is WireMock Edition in the commit history

<!-- TODO: Talk to Sam and have a fork repo/branch -->

## Useful pages

- [WireMock and Kotlin](../solutions/kotlin.md) - Android ecosystem embraces Kotlin as a development language,
  and there are some additional tooling available
- [WireMock on Java and JVM](../solutions/jvm.md) - Some of JVM generic solutions are applicable to Android development too
