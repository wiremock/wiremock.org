WireMock is an open source project.
In accordance with the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/blob/master/LICENSE.txt),
in general there is no support or guarantees provided for it.
At the same time, you can get some assistance through WireMock community channels,
and contribute to helping other users too.
There are also vendors that provide commercial support for WireMock.

## WireMock Community

If youâ€™re looking for help or advice,
you can find a community of users and contributors on the WireMock community Slack channels.
Stack Overflow also has many good WireMock questions and answers.

Note that all the community channels are maintained without any guarantees or a Service Level Agreement (SLA).
All responses are provided by community members, and it is a best effort.
Every community member is welcome to participate, help to triage and answer the questions.

- [WireMock Community Slack](http://slack.wiremock.org/) provides the `#help` channel for Q&A
- [As a question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/wiremock), use the `wiremock` tag
