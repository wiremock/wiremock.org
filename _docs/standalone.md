WireMock can run as a standalone service,
configured via the Java API, JSON over HTTP or JSON files.
We provide the JAR file and Docker image distributions for it.

## Running WireMock

- [Running as a Docker Image](../docker)
- [Running as a JAR file](./java-jar)

## Management

When WireMock runs as a standalone service, it can be managed through its REST API.

- [WireMock Administration](./administration)
- [Admin API Reference](./admin-api-reference/)

## API Clients

There is a number of API clients that work with the standalone WireMock instance.
Check out the [Solution pages](../../docs) for more info and pointers.
