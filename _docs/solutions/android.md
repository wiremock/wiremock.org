## Guide by Sam Edwards

As documented by Sam Edwards in 2016,
with some effort it is now possible to run WireMock 2.x on Android.
Please see
[this blog post](https://handstandsam.com/2016/01/30/running-wiremock-on-android/) for instructions.
This guide is likely no longer applicable to the recent versions.
