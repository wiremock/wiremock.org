# WireMock OSS Documentation

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This is the source project for the official WireMock OSS documentation, now hosting both the Java and .Net edition docs.

This site is build on Starlight - a static documentation site builder based on Astro.

## Contributing to these docs

We welcome contributions to improve the WireMock documentation! Here's how to get started:

### Running the Dev Server Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`

3. **Make your changes:**
   - Edit markdown files in `src/content/docs/`
   - The dev server will automatically reload as you save changes

4. **Preview your changes:**
   - Check your changes in the browser to ensure they look correct
   - Test any links or navigation you've modified

### Submitting Your Contribution

Once you're happy with your changes:

1. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
2. Push your changes to your fork (or create a new branch if you have write access)
3. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch
4. Provide a clear description of what you've changed and why

Your PR will be reviewed by the maintainers. Thank you for contributing to WireMock!
